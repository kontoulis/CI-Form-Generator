CI-Form-Generator
=================

A Codeigniter Library for auto form generation through the form validation set rules.

This library is extending the CI_Form_validation Class.

You dont have to load it separately. 

$this->load->library('form_validation') will work since the calls is an extension of the original.

In the config file, you can set some html elements and classes that will be used in the form.
The default config works with Bootstrap 3. You can change the config depending on your oun css.

I am demonstrating the usage in the form_test controller. If you  have any questions feel free to ask.

It is functioning for normal form tasks. I will encehance it by time.
Feel free to download and fork.
